# About me
I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student at Georgia Tech and a research assistant at NSF Artificial Intelligence Research Institute for Advances in Optimization ([AI4OPT](https://www.ai4opt.org/)). My research with Prof. [Pascal Van Hentenryck](https://sites.gatech.edu/pascal-van-hentenryck/) focuses on applying Machine Learning & Optimization to large-scale real-world planning problems in energy systems ([Risk-Aware Market Clearing](https://ramc.isye.gatech.edu/)), supply chains (Data-Driven Service Network Design), and ride-hailing systems (Reinforcement Learning for Vehicle Relocation).

# Education
* Ph.D. in Machine Learning, Georgia Institute of Technology, 2024 (expected)
